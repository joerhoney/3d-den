This is a conglomeration of my 3D modeling class assignments.

## Assignments

1. Model a chair

- Follow provided image (I might find a way to share that at some point)

2. Create a book nook

- Include shelves and seat
- Include different sized books, not exact duplicates
- Include window with frame and separate geometry for glass

## Tools

- Blender (topic of this class)
- Three.js (not part of this class)

## Notes

- This is based on a 3D modeling class I am attending at Santiago Canyon College in Orange, CA.
- I embellished this work beyond the scope of the original assignment, just to give it more appeal. For instance, materials, backgrounds and lighting were not allowed. The model had to be submitted in default gray with nothing but the geometry.
